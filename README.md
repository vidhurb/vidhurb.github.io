# Vidhur - Resume



An Electronics Engineering student by day and a Web Developer by night.
This is my Portpolio / Resume.

I created this webpage with whatever basic web development skills I have and honestly, some of it was borrowed inspiration from open source projects.
Build using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm prettry proud of it.
